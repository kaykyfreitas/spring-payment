Create a directory with name 'certs'

In the terminal, access the certs directory
Run the follow bash commands

    openssl genrsa -out keypair.pem 2048
    openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out public.pem
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in keypair.pem -out private.pem
    rm keypair.pem

This will generate yours rsa files in the certs directory

After that you will have something like that

    src/main/resources/certs/public.pem
    src/main/resources/certs/private.pem

The certs directory doesn't will be added in the git, save only with you
